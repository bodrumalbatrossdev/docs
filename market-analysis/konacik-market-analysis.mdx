## Future Projections: 3-5 Year Market Outlook

Looking ahead to 2025, the Bodrum property market, including Konacık, is expected to stabilize after a period of economic fluctuation. While some areas will continue to see premium prices, the economic downturn may offer investors a unique chance to secure properties at reduced prices, particularly in less saturated markets like Turgutreis and Gümüşlük ([Aegean Living Investing, 2025](https://aegeanlivinginvesting.com/bodrum-real-estate-investment-2025/)).

The Bodrum real estate market is poised to experience two key trends in 2025: rising demand for vacation homes and the economic pressures on Turkish owners. As the cost of living and inflation soar, many locals who previously invested in Bodrum’s booming market may need to liquidate their assets. This could create a wave of discounted properties, especially in areas that have historically been less saturated ([Aegean Living Investing, 2025](https://aegeanlivinginvesting.com/bodrum-real-estate-investment-2025/)).
