Each settlement of Bodrum peninsula creates a different sensation and feeling inside and Gumusluk is certainly one of them. It’s location is 25 km’s away from Bodrum and 60 km’s away from Milas-Bodrum airport. According to the census the population is 4050. The popularity of the bays, scenery and sunset views attracts both local and foreign visitors. This settlement leads to Yalikavak, the shore line passing on its way leads to lots of different size bays and the remains of the lost city to rabbit island. The main promenade down the sea side offers execellent quality and choices of sea food & Mediterranian cusine. Local residents have their properties to the left and right of the settlement closely followed with the summer houses from outside towards Yalikavak. As there are no night clubs in this area it’s a very quiet place during the night. During the winter season you can only see fisherman & their boats, you will not sea any Gullets or day trip boats.

If you are looking for a quiet area to live then Gumusluk offers you far more affordable prices and possibilities for development. Summer houses are mainly empty during the winter months but May onwards numbers start to swell up until mid autumn.
