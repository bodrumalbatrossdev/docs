This is one of the quietest settlements of Bodrum where fisherman used to dock to off load their catch for the locals and local businesses. It is only 6 kms away from Bodrum and 40 kms from Milas-Bodrum airport. According to census of 2013 population of Torba is 1605 but with the summer season numbers swell to over 10000. The life is very quiet all through out the year,ideal for resting and recharging your batteries.

Most of the coastal areas are already taken up by the hotels and motels leaving very little beach area for public use which means that the local businesses offer their services through their establishments on the beach front.

Due to the fact that Torba Bay is situated on a plateau enclosed by two hills, the winds do not create too much turbalance. In the coastal areas fish restaurants, café’s, boutique hotels, hoilday estates and guest houses (Pansiyon) are available to suit everyones needs.

If you prefer to hire a villa or apartment these are available according to your needs which will give you an enjoyable holiday experience in Torba.
