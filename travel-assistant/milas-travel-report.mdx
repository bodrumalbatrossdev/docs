## History

### Ancient History

Milas, known as Mylasa in ancient times, has a history that dates back to the 3rd millennium B.C. The city was one of the most important centers of the Carian civilization and was named after Mylasos, a descendant of Aeolus, the god of winds ([Ministry of Culture and Tourism](https://www.ktb.gov.tr/EN-36220/milas.html)). The suffix "asa" in Mylasa indicates that the city was founded in very ancient times.

### Medieval and Ottoman Periods

During the medieval period, Milas served as the capital of the Anatolian beylik of Menteşe. The city was later incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1390, but control was briefly returned to the Menteşe Beys after the Battle of Ankara in 1402. Milas was brought back under Ottoman control in 1420 by Sultan Mehmed I ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milas)).

### Modern History

In the early 20th century, Milas was part of the Aidin Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. The city had a diverse population, including Greeks, Jews, and Turks. The Greeks were exchanged with Turks living in Greece under the 1923 agreement, while the Jewish community remained until the 1950s, when they emigrated to Israel ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milas)).
