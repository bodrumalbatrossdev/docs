## Natural Wonders That Will Captivate Your Family

The crown jewel of Dalaman's coastline is the famous Blue Lagoon, where ever-changing shades of turquoise create a natural swimming pool perfect for families. At Iztuzu Beach, known locally as Turtle Beach, witness something truly special between July and September as baby loggerhead turtles make their journey to the sea.

Nature enthusiasts will find their paradise at Sarigerme Beach, where four miles of golden sand meet the majestic Taurus Mountains. The warm, shallow waters provide ideal conditions for young swimmers, while the pine-fringed coastline offers welcome shade during hot summer days.
