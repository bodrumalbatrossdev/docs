### Ottoman Rule

The region of Milas, including Boğaziçi, has a complex history of rule by various empires. The Ottoman Empire took over Milas and the entire Beylik of Menteşe in 1390. However, just twelve years later, Tamerlane and his forces defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara, returning control of the region to its former rulers, the Menteşe Beys. Milas was brought back under Ottoman control in 1420 by Sultan Mehmed I ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milas)).
