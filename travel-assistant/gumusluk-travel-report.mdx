## Historical Background

Gümüşlük is situated on the remains of the ancient city of Myndos, which dates back to the 2nd century BC. The city was initially established by the Lelelegs and later relocated and reconstructed by King Mausolos in the 4th century BC. Myndos was one of the eight Carian cities built by the Lelelegs, and its inhabitants were allowed to remain when Mausolos forced the people of other cities to settle in Halikarnassos (Bodrum) ([Bodrum Peninsula Travel Guide](https://www.bodrumpeninsulatravelguide.co.uk/gumusluk-history/)).

The ancient city of Myndos is partially submerged underwater, and its ruins can be observed along the road that stretches from the Gümüşlük coast to Tavşan Island (Rabbit Island). The remains of the foundations of buildings can be clearly seen in the knee-deep water, providing a fascinating glimpse into the past ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9Fl%C3%BCk)).
