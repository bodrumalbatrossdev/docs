 Turkey has endured as a popular destination for folks who are considering investing in waterfront homes. So, it’s not surprising that this lavish estate built atop a hill overlooking the Mediterranean would rank as one of the most expensive properties on the market. The exact price is available only upon request, but it’s believed to be approximately $110 million. Sited in the seaside resort town of Yalikavak on the shores of the Bodrum peninsula, the ultra-modern mansion is run entirely on solar power and rests on just shy of five acres. There are 22 bedrooms in a little more than 43,000 square feet of living space boasting glitzy amenities like a sauna, steam and massage rooms, and an indoor pool. Additional highlights include a second outdoor pool flanked by a sundeck and a grassy lawn.
