## History of Bodrum

### Ancient Halicarnassus

The history of Bodrum dates back to ancient times when it was known as Halicarnassus. Founded in the 3rd millennium BC, Halicarnassus became one of the most important cities in the region of Caria.

During the Ottoman Empire, Bodrum evolved into a small village and a fishing harbor. Despite its diminished status, it maintained its significance as a maritime center. The town’s economy revolved around fishing, sponge diving, and maritime trade, benefiting from its strategic location along the Aegean Sea.
