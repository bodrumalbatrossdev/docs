In Turkey, real estate loans are in demand among the citizens, and the banks secure themselves increasingly with their customers through guarantees. In the case of real estate loans, a mortgage is directly provided by the banks as collateral in the description of the property on the Tapuamt. In addition to the granting of real estate loans, other possibilities for the allocation of mortgages are also considered. For private and commercial loans, creditors can assign a mortgage to a property owned by the debtor.

Is there the possibility to include another loan, on a property with mortgage?
Before the banks approve a real estate loan, an expert opinion is prepared and a loan is granted to the debtor up to 80% of the value.
If a mortgage is on the property, the banks often give another loan, in which the banks' scope of action is very different. In such a case, the conditions vary according to the creditworthiness and the income situation of the debtor.
If the banks see themselves in security on the basis of your credit request, they are happy to give a second loan to a property.
