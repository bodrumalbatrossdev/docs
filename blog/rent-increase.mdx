According to the scope of the measure published in the New Economy program of 20 September 2018, the highest interest rate to be used in the calculation of the rent increase must be calculated on the basis of the TUE (consumer price index). Homeowners are now obliged to choose not the ÜFE (producer price index) but the TÜFE (consumer price index) rates.

The 12-month OBE numbers for August were 18.78% and TÜFE data were 12.61%. In other words, if the rental price for the [apartment you live in](https://bodrum-albatross.com/en/apartments-for-sale-bodrum.html "apartment for sale Bodrum") is increased in August, the amount to be collected according to the TÜFE data should be calculated at 12.61%. For example, the amount of the rent increase on your 1000TL apartment rental should be calculated as 126 TL from August.
