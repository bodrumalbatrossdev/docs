Broker diary

As a first step, real estate companies spend much of their time researching the market to build and market their real estate portfolio. The seller is urgently looking for customers and kneels in front of the first customer on his knees. The demands for a commission come to the estate agent from the real estate owner, from employees, gardeners of the complex in which the real estate is located, to the near and distant neighbors.

The number of potential real estate agents in Bodrum is the bottomless and this surplus of real estate dealers in Bodrum, ensures opacity. In other words, almost the entire Bodrum Peninsula, is real estate agent!

Everyone reaches out to get some of the cream with their fingers off a giant pie!

People come to Bodrum to buy a property and return home with too much different and half-true input. Real estate agencies that take their place in this complexity, have to fight through the swirl of false market descriptions over and over again. In some cases, success in the election can be achieved, and in some cases, dozens of customers may own a property without a building permit, water, and electricity.

Many buyers are battling the barkers, as the requested offer can not be viewed because it is allegedly already sold or the price has changed dramatically.

In the jungle of the real estate market should everyone use their brains, or did they buy at home from the fish market crier or hairdresser a property without any guarantees?
