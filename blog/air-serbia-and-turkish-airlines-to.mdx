## Enhanced Connectivity and Route Expansion

The partnership marks a substantial evolution in regional air travel, with both carriers committed to expanding their route networks and increasing flight frequencies. Air Serbia currently operates flights from Belgrade, Niš, and Kraljevo to various Turkish destinations, while Turkish Airlines maintains a robust presence in Serbia with triple daily flights to Belgrade from Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines' low-cost subsidiary, AJet, has also entered the market, launching operations from multiple Turkish cities to Belgrade, further strengthening the air bridge between the two countries.

## Beyond Code Sharing: Potential Joint Venture

What makes this partnership particularly intriguing is the ongoing exploration of a Joint Venture agreement, initiated in 2023. This deep-level cooperation would involve revenue sharing and coordinated route planning, signaling a significant step beyond traditional codeshare arrangements.

## Technical Innovation and Infrastructure Development

In a move that could revolutionize aircraft maintenance in the region, Turkish Airlines is considering establishing a subsidiary of Turkish Technic in Serbia. This maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facility in Belgrade would primarily service Air Serbia's fleet, creating a strategic technical hub in the Balkans.

## Looking Ahead

This comprehensive partnership represents more than just increased flight options—it symbolizes a strategic alignment between two key players in the regional aviation market. As these airlines continue to integrate their operations, passengers can expect enhanced connectivity, improved service quality, and a more seamless travel experience between Serbia and Turkey.

The collaboration sets a precedent for regional aviation partnerships and could serve as a model for future agreements in the evolving European aviation landscape.
