In Bodrum there is a special variety, the Bodrum Mandarine, in the numerous mandarin gardens. The chocolate shop Meyflower Ã‡ikolata has used this Bodrum specialty and made a unique mandarin chocolate. The chocolate contains no additives. The ingredients are mandarin peel, mandarin puree and pure chocolate. The chocolate has to be consumed within 3 months as it does not last longer due to its biological nature.
