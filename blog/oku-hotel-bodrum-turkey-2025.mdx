Set spectacularly along Bodrum peninsula’s northern coast, OKU Bodrum Hotel, opening in summer 2025, will be an adult’s only (16+) retreat within one of Europe’s most sought after destinations. The hotel’s idyllic location will offer direct access to a protected bay for swimming and will be perfectly positioned for exploring the peninsula by both land and sea. The boutique hotel will offer just 58 rooms and suites, each one offering front-facing sea views, terraces from which toenjoy the sunset, and many with a private pool. For dining, guests can enjoy a choice of three outlets, with a range of options including relaxed local fare and OKU’s much-loved fusion cuisine. OKU’s signature Japanese fusion restaurant, OKU Restaurant, will be in an open-air setting, reflecting both a tropical and Japanese garden. The OKU Spa will be the ideal place to retreat for wellness rituals of differing practices, boasting a hammam, sauna, relaxation space, and openair seafront treatment cabanas.
